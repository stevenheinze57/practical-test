I unforuntately could not get this fully going. I was able to get Jenkins running along with minikube, but became stuck on getting connections between the cluster and the jenkins server working. I believe I would at this point need to instead try and deploy jenkins onto the cluster itself and allow connectivity/authorization. This would be the easiest and quickest way I believe.
